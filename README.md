Brain_Tumor_TFLearning_model_resnet50.ipynb : This is the notebook where we implement the model with base as resnet50 and evaluate the model. 

Predictor.ipynb : This is the notebook where we use the above model and test it's accuracy on Other brain tumour dataset to check its robustness.

Brain_Tumor_TFLearning_MobileNetV2_model.ipynb:  This is the notebook where we implement the model with base as MobileNetV2 and evaluate the model.

Brain_Tumor_CNN_model.ipynb: This is the notebook where we implement the simple CNN model without using Transfer Learning.{preliminary results}
